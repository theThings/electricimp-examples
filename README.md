# electricimp-examples

In this section you will find examples that both use electric-imp and TheThings.iO organized in folders.

To include the TheThingsApi class, add #require "TheThingsAPI.class.nut:1.0.0" to the beginning of your agent code. The API, some general examples and the source code of the library can be found in the [Electric Imp GitHub](https://github.com/electricimp/TheThingsAPI)

Feel free to contribute with your own examples! :-)
