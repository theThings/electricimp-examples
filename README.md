# electricimp-examples

In this section you will find examples that both use electric-imp and TheThings.iO organized in folders.

Into the file TheThingsAPI.class.nut you will find the main class to access the TheThings.iO services quick and smooth! In essence, with this class you will be able to activate new things, write and read.

Feel free to contribute with your own examples! :-)
